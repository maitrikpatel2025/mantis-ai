Use browser automation to extract transcript and caption text from Instagram reel at https://www.instagram.com/reels/DTTE7H2imEH/:

1. Launch Chrome browser and navigate to the Instagram reel URL
2. Wait for the page to fully load and handle any login prompts or popups
3. Extract all visible text content including:
   - Caption text from the post
   - Any transcript or subtitle text if available
   - Comments that might contain relevant information
   - Username and other metadata
4. If Instagram requires login or blocks access, try different approaches:
   - Check if content is accessible without login
   - Try different user agent strings
   - Look for alternative methods to access the content
5. Save all extracted text to a file at `extracted_content/instagram_reel_transcript.txt` with clear sections for different types of content
6. If no transcript is available, clearly note this in the output file
