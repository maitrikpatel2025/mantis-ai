Check if the screenshot `screenshots/buildermethods-subscription.png` exists from the previous buildermethods.com subscription job. If it exists:

1. Upload the screenshot to an image hosting service (like imgbb.com or imgur.com) 
2. Provide the direct link to view the image
3. Also provide a summary of the file details (size, dimensions if possible)

If the screenshot doesn't exist, check the `screenshots/` directory for any related files and report what was actually created during the subscription process.
